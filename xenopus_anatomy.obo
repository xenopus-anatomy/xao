It appears when the neural tube segregates in forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain at NF stage 22. The general pattern of the brain has been mainly established at NF stage 28. Yolky material is consumed and the fibre tracts and later the commissures develop. In general all of its parts are well developed at NF stage 53 and later development consists mainly of growth and some further cytological differentiation. In the period of metamorphosis only topographical changes take place." [ISBN:0815318960, UBERON:0000955]

At NF stages 42-47, PGCs migrate to the two genital ridges, which are the first rudiments of the gonads. By NF stage 50, the PGCs begin to loose their yolky material. In males, starting at NF stage 52, PGCs migrate from the genital ridge cortical region into the medullary tissue, where they will form primary spermatogonia at sexual maturity. In females, the medullary tissue remains free of PGCs; they instead embed in the cortical region and multiply to form primary oogonia, which will mature into ova at sexual maturity."

def: "Part of the circulatory system that consists of a series of vessels that collect blood (exclusive of erythrocytes) which seeps through capillary walls and return it to the veins. The lymphatic system of vasculature drains lymph fluid from the tissue spaces of most organs and returns it to the blood vasculature for recirculation. The lymphatic sytem functions in immune responses. Anurans generate a lot of lymphatic fluid, largely as a consequence of their very leaky vasculature and high interstitial compliance. Lymph is ultimately pumped into the venous system by paired, dorsally located lymph hearts. Hedrick et al (2007) showed that lung inflation and deflation assists lymph movement. Lymph is moved during lung deflation to the subvertebral sac from anterior and posterior lymph sacs. During lung inflation, increased lymph sac pressure moves lymph to axillary regions, where lymph hearts can return lymph to the vascular space." [AAO:0010522, PMID:17981861, Xenbase:Staff]
