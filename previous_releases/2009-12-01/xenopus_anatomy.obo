Yolky material is consumed and the fibre tracts and later the commissures develop. In general all of its parts are well developed at NF stage 53 and later development consists mainly of growth and some further cytological differentiation. In the period of metamorphosis only topographical changes take place." [ISBN:0815318960 "Nieuwkoop and Faber (pg. 30-59)", OMD:brain "CancerWeb Online Medical Dictionary"]
